# Introduction

## Amazon Elastic Container Service

Run highly secure, reliable, and scalable containers

**Why Amazon ECS?**

Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) is a fully managed container orchestration `(tự động hoá triển khai)` service that helps you to more efficiently `(tính từ: hiệu quả)` deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications. It deeply integrates `(tích hợp)` with the AWS environment to provide an easy-to-use solution for running container workloads in the cloud and on premises with advanced security features using Amazon ECS Anywhere.

### How it works

Simply describe your application and the resources required, and Amazon ECS will launch, monitor, and scale your application across flexible compute options with automatic integrations `(tích hợp)` to other supporting AWS services that your application needs. Perform system operations such as creating custom scaling and capacity rules, and observe and query data from application logs and telemetry.

## AWS ECS Vs. EKS: Key Differences

When comparing ECS and EKS, you’ll find that while these tools serve a similar purpose, they have several fundamental differences. Let’s review the key differences.

**1. Platform Integration**

When it comes to platform integration, AWS ECS and EKS offer different advantages. AWS ECS is a native AWS service, meaning it integrates seamlessly with other AWS services like Elastic Load Balancer, AWS Fargate and Amazon RDS. This ease of integration simplifies the deployment and management of applications.

On the other hand, EKS is based on the open source Kubernetes platform, which offers the flexibility to run your applications both on-premises and in the cloud. While this flexibility is advantageous, it does require more effort to integrate with AWS services compared to ECS.

**2. Scalability**

Scalability is a crucial factor when choosing a container orchestration service. AWS ECS shines in this aspect, as it can automatically scale your applications based on the demand. ECS also supports both Fargate and EC2 launch types, providing greater flexibility in terms of scalability.

EKS, while also scalable, requires a more hands-on approach. You need to manually configure the autoscaling groups and use Kubernetes’ Horizontal Pod Autoscaler for your applications to scale. This process is more complex and requires additional management compared to ECS.

**3. Security**

AWS ECS leverages the robust security features of AWS, offering features like IAM roles for tasks, security groups, and VPC network isolation. These features ensure that your applications are secure from threats.

EKS also offers robust security features, but it relies heavily on Kubernetes’ native security features. It offers Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), Network Policies, and Secret Management. While these features are powerful, they require in-depth knowledge of Kubernetes, which can be a steep learning curve for some teams.

**4. Pricing Models**

In terms of pricing, both AWS ECS and EKS offer flexible pricing models that align with your usage. AWS ECS pricing is based on the resources such as vCPU and memory that your containers consume. Notably, there is no additional charge for ECS; you only pay for the AWS resources you use.

EKS, on the other hand, charges a flat fee for each EKS cluster you run, in addition to the resource consumption costs. This means that while EKS can be cost-effective for smaller projects with only a few clusters, it may be more expensive for large organizations with many clusters.

**5. Complexity**

The complexity of managing and operating these services is an important consideration. AWS ECS, being a native AWS service, is generally easier to set up and manage. It integrates well with AWS management tools, reducing the complexity and time required for operations.

EKS, being based on the open-source Kubernetes platform, requires a deeper understanding of Kubernetes. While this offers more control and flexibility, it also adds to the complexity of managing and operating your applications.

**AWS ECS Vs. EKS: How to Choose?**

Choosing between AWS ECS and EKS depends on your specific needs, resources, and expertise. If you are already embedded in the AWS ecosystem and require a simple, integrated solution for container management, ECS is likely the best choice. Its seamless integration with other AWS services, automatic scalability, robust security features, and straightforward pricing model make it an excellent choice for businesses of all sizes.

However, if you require the flexibility to run your applications both on-premises and in the cloud, and have the resources and expertise to manage a more complex system, EKS may be a better fit. It offers more control over your applications, robust security features, and can be cost-effective for large-scale applications.

In conclusion, both AWS ECS and EKS are powerful container orchestration services that can meet a variety of needs. By understanding their key differences and aligning them with your specific requirements, you can make an informed choice and leverage these services to drive your business forward in the digital landscape.
